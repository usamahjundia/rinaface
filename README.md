# Rina Face Board
I'm learning react. Nothing to do at work so i pulled this out.

Not my original idea, i'm trying to imitate [this amazing website](http://rinachanboard.com/) made by @nowigen.

# TODO
- Add actual presets so i dont have to input faces everytime
- Find a way to export the face into some format i can use for a custom lcd device
- Add options to reset, to load preset, to create, etc..
